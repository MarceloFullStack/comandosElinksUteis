In general this can happen because the OS (window system) has priority and intercepts this shortcut and stops propagation to your desired application. Solution: Removing the shortcuts using dconf-editor:

sudo apt-get install dconf-tools
dconf-editor
in dconf-editor go to: /org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/
Find switch-to-workspace-down, put ['disabled'] instead of default
same for ...-up
quit dconf-editor and you are done
I always have this problem when I want to use some Eclipse IDE shortcuts: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=321094
