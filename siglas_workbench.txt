PK - Primary Key

NN - Not Null

BIN - Binary (stores data as binary strings. There is no character set so sorting and comparison is based on the numeric values of the bytes in the values.)

UN - Unsigned (non-negative numbers only. so if the range is -500 to 500, instead its 0 - 1000, the range is the same but it starts at 0)

UQ - Create/remove Unique Key

ZF - Zero-Filled (if the length is 5 like INT(5) then every field is filled with 0â€™s to the 5th digit. 12 = 00012, 400 = 00400, etc. )

AI - Auto Increment

G - Generated column. i.e. value generated by a formula based on the other columns
